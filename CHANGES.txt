v0.1.2, 5/22/13 -- Changed directory structure. pynfg.rlsolutions became pynfg.levelksolutions. 
v0.1.2, 5/22/13 -- Fixed DecisionNode._createCPT so that DNs without parents have first dimension of size 1.
v0.1.2, 5/22/13 -- Created best response (bestresponse), logit response (logitresponse). These are located in pynfg.levelksolutions. This is also where we will put d-relaxed (name?).
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- Added mceu to pynfg.utilities.utilities. It computes the move-conditioned expected utilities for a decision node given the game.
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- Bug fixes in SemiNFG.sample, DeterNode.prob, ChanceNode.draw_value, ChanceNode.prob, pgtsolutions.intelligence.coordinated and uncoordinated
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- New error handling in Node.get_valueindex
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- New internal structure for setting and getting node values and valueindex.
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- Bug fix in ChanceNode.draw_value
v0.1.2, 5/28/13 -- Removed sliver option from DecisionNode.perturbCPT
v0.1.2, 5/23/13 -- Changed simplex draws to faster Dirichlet method in DecisionNode.randomCPT
v0.1.2, 6/11/13 -- Bug fixes in MH PGT algorithms
v0.1.2, 6/27/13 -- Created set_CPTs and get_decisionCPTs for semiNFG and used them to replace deepcopy operations in multiple algorithms
